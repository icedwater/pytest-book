# Python Testing with pytest

Here's another work through of a Python testing book! Let's hope this
one goes better than the ones before so far.

## Environment

I've started this on stock Ubuntu 16.04 so python3 defaulted to 3.5.2
but I wanted to work with a newer version of stuff, so I set up a 3.8
venv.

## Packaging/Distribution

I went with Appendix 4 before Chapter 2, to learn how to package some
Python code into a distributable package. So that explains the pretty
lame `amod` directory which just has `ans_all()` that returns 42.

I'll probably play around with that more later on.
