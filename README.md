# Python Testing with pytest

Here's another work through of a Python testing book! Let's hope this
one goes better than the ones before so far.

## Environment

I've started this on stock Ubuntu 16.04 so python3 defaulted to 3.5.2
but I wanted to work with a newer version of stuff, so I set up a 3.8
venv.

## Book

Python Testing with pytest. Okken, B. 2017. ISBN: 978-1-68050-240-4
